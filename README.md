# Description
This is a project I completed while doing a course on Pluralsight called Spring Framework: Spring 5 Fundamentals. 
This app manages registration of speakers at a conference. While I had previously configured this project using Java configuration and annotations, 
I have now wired the app using XML. As a way to learn more about the spring framework and how dependency injection works, I initially wired the apps through 
setters and constructors before autowiring it. 

##Technologies Used:
Java, Maven, XML, Spring
